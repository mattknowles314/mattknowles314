### Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Matthew, I see you've stumbled across my Github profile, please enjoy your stay.

## Who am I? 

* 🎓  I'm currently a Mathematics undergraduate at the University of York in the UK. I am primarily focusing on Algebra and Number Theory!
* 📚  Languages are a huge part of my life, I speak English, Norwegian, German, Russian as well as some Mandarin Chinese and Urdu.
* 🖥  My interests in Computing are operating systems, complexity theory and applications of machine learning/big data to problems in medicine and finance.
* 🏏  Outside of academia I play a lot of sport, I run long distance, I play cricket at quite a high standard, and practice taekwondo and hockey at university.

## What do I do?

* 🎓  I am in my third year of university, my focus is pure maths, with some stats thrown in for good measure. Current modules:
  + Practical Data Science with R
  + Linear Optimisation and Game Theory
  + Galois Theory
  + Topology
  + Cryptography
  
## What am I good at?

* ✅  Maths: From linear algebra all the way through to fluid dynamics. There are some parts of maths I like less (*cough* analysis *cough*) but by now I'm pretty    good at solving problems in several areas of maths.
* 📈  Data Analysis: This is the practical side of maths I have the most real world experience of. From simple linear regression all the way up to training neural networks, I love it all!
* 💻  Programming languages: Python, R and C++ are the languages I have used the most, I also took a Java course at university.
* 🏏  Cricket: Not that it matters, I just love cricket.

## Thank's for visiting!
