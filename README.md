### Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm Matthew, I see you've stumbled across my Github profile, please enjoy your stay.

## Who am I? 

* 🎓  I'm currently a Masters student in Mathematics at the University of York in the UK. 
* 📚  Languages are a huge part of my life, I speak English, Norwegian, German and Russian as well as some Mandarin Chinese and Urdu.
* 🖥  My interests in Computing are algorithms, complexity theory and applications of machine learning/big data to problems in finance and medicine.
* 🏏  Outside of academia I play a lot of sport, I play representative cricket for my university, as well as captaining my college's hockey team and I am currently training for a sub 3:30 marathon.

## What do I do?

* 🎓 I am finishing up my masters degree at UoY, specialising in Financial Mathematics.
* 🧬 In June, I will be joining OPEN Health as a statistical analyst.
* 🖥  I have spent this summer working on implementing financial models for pricing options contracts

## What am I good at?

* ✅  Maths: From linear algebra all the way through to fluid dynamics. There are some parts of maths I like less (*cough* analysis *cough*) but by now I'm pretty    good at solving problems in several areas of maths.
* 📈  Data Analysis: This is the practical side of maths I have the most real world experience of. From simple linear regression all the way up to training neural networks, I love it all!
* 💻  Programming languages: Python, R and C++ are the languages I have used the most, I also took a Java course at university.

## Thank's for visiting!
