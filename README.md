### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Matthew.

  of pure and applied maths.

## What am I good at?

* âœ…  Maths: From linear algebra all the way through to fluid dynamics. There are some parts of maths I like less (*cough* analysis *cough*) but by now I'm pretty    good at solving problems in several areas of maths.
* ðŸ“ˆ  Data Analysis: This is the practical side of maths I have the most real world experience of. From simple linear regression all the way up to training neural networks, I love it all!
* ðŸ’»  Programming languages: Python, R and C++ are the languages I have used the most, I also took a Java course at university.
